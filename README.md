# Description
This project was created for academic purposes, but I
thought it would be worth sharing it for public review.
Basicaly it is a primitive text-based rpg-like game
where you can write your own scenarios if you like.

The main goal of this project was to create a fully functional
game with options, saves and editable scenarios.

I used SFML to manage audio and json files for saving
settings, items, npcs, scenarios, save, etc.

It is recommended to use this project with visual studio
because it is already configured it. Please check
Windows SDK in the project first when problems occur.
